## Information Breakdown
![Summary of Information](https://github.com/CoryCMyers/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Capture.PNG)

When we look at the information for the total rides we see that
   * The total number of urban rides is rought 2.5 times the number of suburban rides
   * The total number of urban rides is roughly 13 times the number of rural rides
      * If effort could be made in these markets to drive sales this metric could be improved
   * Possible Methods
      * Create Flex/Hot hours within driver app based on past/targeted usage volumes
      * Could help to shape behavior/habit flow
      * Establish these hours during normal times for Disabled/Elderly to need travel to shops
